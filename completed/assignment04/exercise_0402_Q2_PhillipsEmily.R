# Check distributions of the data

#Distribution of 'Sale Price' is negatively skewed -- more prices at the lower end of the distribution
#Would have to look at the real estate in these cities/zip codes around these dates and check the city mean/median price
#However, most of the houses are in the range from $0 - $1,000,000 which is pretty standard
#I need to look into the houses around $0, because that would be impossible for an object you are purchasing :)
ggplot(housing_df, aes(x=housing_df$'Sale Price')) + geom_histogram(bins=12)

#The distribution of the variable, year_built, is positively skewed
#Most of the houses were built anytime from 1970s to current day which I also think is pretty standard
#For the older houses, they will probably need some renovations eventually and may even need to be knocked down or rebuilt
#Many old houses, as old as the 1920s, would most likely not be livable anymore

#Summary function

#The house that has a sales price of $698 is an outlier
#Looking at the summary info for this variable, the minimum value is $698 and the maximum value is $4.4 million
#When looking at the data for the $698 dollar homes, they are relatively high in square feet and have multiple bedrooms,
#which is inplausible for a house that is so cheap
#Also, the first quartile for this variable starts at $460,000 which puts $698 way below the first range, marking it as an outlier

#Looking at 240 square foot total living
#This home is also an outlier ... 240 square feet total living with a sales price of $687,500 is crazy!
#From looking at the other homes that have a sales price of $687,500 or higher, 240 square feet is the minumum with the first quartile starting at 2700 square feet
#240 is quite different than 2700, which marks this home also as an outlier
